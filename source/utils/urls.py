"""
Centralized URL provider.
The purpose of this module is to provide a centralized location for all
URLs used as part of the NVDA source, and a singleton to manage them.
This will make it unnecessary to search code when URLs need to be
updated, and will provide a central mechanism for URLs to be changed
at runtime by add-ons.

Usage:

It is intended that all URLs be managed by a single object.

```
from utils.urls import URLs

# Add the URL for NV Access:
URLs.add("nvAccess", "https://nvaccess.org")

# Read access:
ui.browseableMessage(URLs.nvAccess, title="A link to NV Access")

# Divert the NV Access URL to somewhere else, such as an add-on might do:
URLs.divert(
	"nvAccess",
	reason="Our country does not allow this URL to be reached directly",
	URL="https://fake.proxy.site/target=nvaccess.org"
)
```

The info level log will contain notices as URLs are requested, and will
note the reason if they have been diverted.
